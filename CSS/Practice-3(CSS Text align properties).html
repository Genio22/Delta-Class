      Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by
      scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby,
      the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and
      received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his
      creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero team, the
      Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. Iron Man stories,
      individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since
      the character's creation.

    <h2>Publication History</h2>

    <h3>Premiere</h3>
    <p>
      Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent
      revival of superhero comic books, Marvel set about creating new superhero
      characters. During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept for
      Iron Man.[1] Lee was interested in designing an unlikeable character and
      making him likeable.[2] Iron Man was created in the years after a
      permanent arms industry developed in the United States, and this was
      incorporated into the character's backstory.[3] The character was
      introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the
      national mood toward Vietnam in which Iron Man was created as "a time when
      most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really
      was a simple matter of good versus evil".[4]

      A comic book cover featuring Iron Man in a simple gray suit of armor Tales
      of Suspense #39 (March 1963): Iron Man debuts. Cover art by Jack Kirby and
      Don Heck. A comic book cover featuring Iron Man in red and gold armor
      bursting through a wall to confront a villain Tales of Suspense #48
      (December 1963), the debut of Iron Man's first red-and-gold suit of armor.
      Cover art by Jack Kirby and Sol Brodsky. Tony Stark inherited his family's
      business, Stark Industries, after his parents were killed in a car
      crash.[72] Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to a war
      zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. His heart is
      critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist
      Wong-Chu, who demands that Tony build him a weapon. Tony instead builds a
      suit of armor that sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man.[17][5] The war
      zone that Tony visits has been changed multiple times by different writers
      to correspond with the character's age, which is explained by a "sliding
      scale of continuity" in which the timing of significant events in the
      world of Marvel may change. For the first decades of Iron Man's
      publication history, the conflict is the Vietnam War.[73] This was changed
      retroactively in the 1990s to an unnamed Southeast Asian country,[74] and
      a conflict in the fictional country of Siancong was eventually established
      to justify the inconsistency.[75]
